    "text": "Clouds AO worked with NASA Langley Research Center and a team of experts to develop a concept design and feasibility study for Mars Ice Home, a deployable Mars habitat concept. Galactic cosmic radiation is a significant issue for human health on long duration Mars surface missions. Mars Ice Home is a deployable Mars habitat concept based on an inflatable structure that incorporates in situ resource utilization derived water ice as radiation shielding and as a structural component. Ice Home also provides a large, flexible, and cost effective workspace that can be used for many of the key activities that will be critical for the long term success of a human outpost on Mars.

    "text": "The base consists of 88 modules. They will be transported separately to Mars and will form a bigger inner space when connected to each other. There will be a laboratory, a gym, cooking and dining areas and areas for the manufacture of rocket fuel. There are the so-called air locks between the different zones, which provide better security to the spacemen, if a given area gets damaged. Besides, there will be enough oxygen, electricity and water at the base. The project also envisages the construction of an aquaponics system which would allow astronauts to grow plants and produce their own food. Author: Architect Yavor Ivanov"

    "text": "This concept, by Richard Heidmann, Association Planete Mars vice president, based on flat glass technology is not conventional, but it does meet the requirements of a 'residential base' scenario. Now, manufacturing the windowpanes presents real technical challenges, whether provisioning additives or implementing the production ovens. Mounting the windowpanes in steel structures will definitely not be easy either. This study therefore should be regarded more as a preliminary and exploratory research rather than a recommended solution."

This system is referred to as the Universal Orbital Support System (UOSS). By placing a large asteroid into orbit over earth, a high strength cable can be lowered towards the surface of earth from which a super tall tower can be suspended. Since this new tower typology is suspended in the air, it can be constructed anywhere in the world and transported to its final location"

The configuration consists of a pair of cylinders, each 20 miles long and 4 miles in diameter. Each cylinder has three land areas alternating with three windows, and three mirrors that open and close to form a day-night cycle inside. The total land area inside a pair of cylinders is about 500 square miles and can house several million people. The cylinders are always in pairs which rotate in opposite directions, cancelling out any gyroscopic effect that would otherwise make it difficult to keep them aimed toward the sun."
